1\. Disclaimer: Base44 vs. Traditional Backend
----------------------------------------------

This document describes a hypothetical, traditional backend architecture. Your current application on Base44 abstracts away almost all of this complexity. Base44 provides the database, authentication, file storage, and serverless functions out of the box, allowing you to focus on the frontend and business logic via the Entities SDK.

This guide is for educational purposes to illustrate what a complete, self-hosted backend for this application would entail.

2\. Part 1: High-Level System Architecture
------------------------------------------

A robust, traditional backend isn't just one application; it's a collection of services working together.

### Components Explained:

-   Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic from the frontend across multiple application servers to prevent any single server from being overloaded.
-   Application Server (Django/Node.js): The core of the backend. It handles API requests, processes business logic, and communicates with the database. It's "stateless," meaning it doesn't store user session information locally, allowing any server to handle any request.
-   Database (PostgreSQL): The persistent storage for all your data (users, tasks, teams, etc.). PostgreSQL is chosen for its robustness and support for complex queries.
-   Cache (Redis): A high-speed, in-memory store used to cache frequently accessed data (like user permissions or team details) to reduce database load and speed up responses.
-   Task Queue (RabbitMQ/Redis): A message broker that holds background jobs. When a long-running task is needed (like sending an email or generating a report), the app server places a "job" in this queue.
-   Worker (Celery/BullMQ): A separate process that listens to the Task Queue. It picks up jobs and executes them asynchronously, so the user doesn't have to wait. This is essential for features like notifications and recurring tasks.
-   File Storage (AWS S3/MinIO): A dedicated service for storing user-uploaded files (attachments, profile pictures). Files are not stored on the application server's file system.

| Validation | DRF Serializers | `class-validator` and `class-transformer` (in NestJS) |
| Containerization | Docker, Docker Compose | Docker, Docker Compose |

* * * * *

4\. Part 3: API Design (RESTful API)
------------------------------------

The frontend communicates with the backend via a well-defined RESTful API.

### Key Principles:

-   Resource-Based URLs: Each entity is a resource. Examples:
    -   `/api/v1/teams/` (List all teams, create a team)
    -   `/api/v1/teams/{team_id}/` (Get/update/delete a specific team)
    -   `/api/v1/teams/{team_id}/members/` (List members of a team)
    -   `/api/v1/boards/{board_id}/tasks/` (List tasks in a board)
-   Standard HTTP Methods:
    -   `GET`: Retrieve data.
    -   `POST`: Create new data.
    -   `PUT`/`PATCH`: Update existing data.
    -   `DELETE`: Remove data.
-   Stateless Authentication: Each request from the frontend must include a `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>` header. The server validates this token on every request to identify the user and check permissions.
-   Standard JSON Response Format:

    ```
    // Successful Response (GET list)
    {
      "count": 120,
      "next": "/api/v1/tasks/?page=2",
      "previous": null,
      "data": [
        { "id": "task_1", "title": "My first task", ... },
        { "id": "task_2", "title": "My second task", ... }
      ]
    }

    // Error Response
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "permission_denied",
        "message": "You do not have permission to perform this action."
      }
    }

    ```

* * * * *

5\. Part 4: Database Schema & Models (The Data Layer)
-----------------------------------------------------

This is the blueprint for your data, implemented using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper).

### ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)

```
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ TeamMember : "has"
    User ||--o{ Task : "is_assignee_of"
    User ||--o{ FormSubmission : "submits"

    Team ||--|{ TeamMember : "contains"
    Team ||--o{ Board : "owns"
    Team ||--o{ TaskTemplate : "owns"
    Team ||--o{ Form : "owns"

    Board ||--o{ List : "contains"
    Board ||--o{ Task : "contains"

    List ||--o{ Task : "contains"

    TaskTemplate ||--o{ Task : "generates"

    Form ||--o{ FormField : "has_many"
    Form ||--o{ FormSchedule : "can_be_scheduled"
    Form ||--o{ FormAssignment : "is_assigned_via"

    FormSchedule ||--o{ FormAssignment : "generates"

    FormAssignment ||--o{ Task : "can_be_linked_to"
    FormAssignment ||--o{ FormSubmission : "is_fulfilled_by"

```

### Example Models (Django ORM syntax)

This is how the relationships above would be translated into code.

```
# models.py in a Django app

from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

class User(AbstractUser):
    # Inherits username, password, email, etc.
    # Add your custom fields here
    profile_completed = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    wip_limit = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=3)

class Team(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    owner = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='owned_teams')
    members = models.ManyToManyField(User, through='TeamMember', related_name='teams')

class TeamMember(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    team = models.ForeignKey(Team, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    role = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('member', 'Member'), ('manager', 'Manager')])

class Task(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=20, default='todo')
    assignee = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True)
    list = models.ForeignKey('List', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    board = models.ForeignKey('Board', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    due_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)

```

6\. Part 5: Core Services & Business Logic
------------------------------------------

This section details *how* the backend would implement the application's key features.

### A. User & Authentication Service

-   Endpoint: `/api/v1/auth/register/`, `/api/v1/auth/login/`, `/api/v1/users/me/`
-   Logic:
    1.  Registration: Accepts email and password. Hashes the password using a strong algorithm like bcrypt. Creates a new `User` record.
    2.  Login: Accepts email and password. Retrieves the user, compares the provided password with the stored hash. If they match, it generates a JWT (JSON Web Token) containing the `user_id` and an expiration time. This token is sent back to the frontend.
    3.  Permissions: A middleware checks the JWT on every protected request. It decodes the token to identify the user and attaches the `user` object to the request. This user object is then used to check permissions for every subsequent action (e.g., "Is `request.user` a member of the team that owns this task?").

### B. Recurring Task & Notification Service (The Asynchronous Part)

-   Endpoint: `/api/v1/task-templates/`
-   Logic:
    1.  Template Creation: User defines a `TaskTemplate` with a recurrence rule (e.g., "every Monday").
    2.  Scheduler (`Celery Beat`): A scheduled task runs every minute or hour. It queries for `TaskTemplate`s that are due to spawn a new task.
    3.  Task Creation Worker (`Celery`): When a template is due, the scheduler enqueues a "create_task_from_template" job in the Task Queue.
    4.  A Worker picks up the job, creates a new `Task` record in the database with the correct details, and updates the `last_spawned_at` timestamp on the template.
    5.  Notification Logic: The worker can then enqueue *another* job, "send_task_assignment_notification", for the newly created task. A different worker picks this up and sends an email or creates an in-app notification.

### C. Forms & Submissions Service

-   Endpoint: `/api/v1/forms/`, `/api/v1/forms/{id}/submit/`
-   Logic:
    1.  Form Definition: The structure of a form (fields, types, labels) is stored as a JSON object in the `Form` model.
    2.  Submission: When a user submits a form, the frontend sends a JSON payload of the answers.
    3.  Backend Validation: The backend retrieves the form's definition and validates the submission payload against it (e.g., checks if required fields are present, if data types match). This is a critical security step.
    4.  Storage: If valid, the submission data is saved as a JSON object in the `FormSubmission` table.

### D. Authorization & Permissions Logic

This is woven into every part of the application.

-   Example Flow: Updating a Task
    1.  Frontend sends `PATCH /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}/` with `Authorization` header.
    2.  Authentication middleware validates the token and finds the user.
    3.  The `update_task` view is called.
    4.  Permission Check: The view performs a database query: "Does a `TeamMember` record exist where `user_id` is the current user's ID and `team_id` is the team that owns the board that owns this task?"
    5.  If yes, the update proceeds. If no, the backend returns a `403 Forbidden` error.

* * * * *

7\. Part 6: Security, Scalability & Deployment
----------------------------------------------

### A. Security

-   Password Hashing: Never store plain-text passwords.
-   Input Validation: Sanitize all user input on the backend to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
-   ORM for SQL Injection Prevention: Using an ORM like Django's or TypeORM naturally prevents most SQL injection vulnerabilities.
-   CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): Configure the backend to only accept requests from your frontend's domain.
-   Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (like login) to prevent brute-force attacks.

### B. Scalability

-   Stateless Servers: The application servers don't store session state, allowing you to add more servers easily behind a load balancer as traffic grows.
-   Asynchronous Workers: Offloading heavy tasks to workers ensures the API remains fast and responsive for users.
-   Database Scaling: Start with a single powerful database instance. As you grow, you can introduce read replicas to distribute read load.

### C. Deployment (CI/CD)

-   Containerization: The entire application (app server, workers, database, etc.) is packaged into Docker containers. `docker-compose.yml` defines how they all run together in a development environment.
-   Continuous Integration (CI): When a developer pushes code to GitHub, a service like GitHub Actions automatically runs tests.
-   Continuous Deployment (CD): If tests pass, the CI/CD pipeline automatically builds new Docker images and deploys them to a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
