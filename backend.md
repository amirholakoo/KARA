Since your project is built on the Base44 platform, it's important to understand that you don't have a traditional, self-hosted backend (like a Node.js or Django server). Instead, the Base44 platform itself acts as your backend. This is a concept known as Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS).

Here is a complete design overview, explaining how the "backend" is structured within the Base44 ecosystem and the relationships between your data entities.

* * * * *

### Part 1: The Conceptual Backend Architecture (The Base44 Model)

The "Karara" application's backend is composed of several managed services provided by Base44:

1.  Authentication Service:

    -   Responsibility: Handles all user login, logout, and session management. It securely manages user identities.
    -   How it works: When a user logs in, they are redirected to Base44's authentication service. Upon success, the service issues a secure token (JWT) that your frontend application uses to make authenticated requests. You interact with this service via the `User` entity SDK (`User.me()`, `User.login()`, `User.logout()`).
2.  Database & Entity API:

    -   Responsibility: Securely stores and retrieves all your application data.
    -   How it works: Every entity you defined in the `entities/` folder (like `Task`, `Team`, `Form`) is a table in a managed database. Base44 automatically creates a secure REST API for each entity. You interact with this API through the simple-to-use Entities SDK (`Task.create()`, `Team.filter()`, etc.), so you don't have to write API code yourself.
3.  Serverless Functions:

    -   Responsibility: Executes custom backend logic that doesn't fit into simple data operations.
    -   How it works: We've used this for the notification system (`components/utils/notificationService.js` and `backgroundTasks.js`). The logic defined there runs on Base44's infrastructure on a schedule to check for overdue items and send reminders, creating `Notification` records in the database.
4.  File Storage:

    -   Responsibility: Securely stores any files uploaded by users (e.g., attachments to tasks or forms).
    -   How it works: When a user uploads a file, it's sent to Base44's managed file storage service, which returns a secure URL. This URL is then saved in an `Attachment` entity record.

### Part 2: The Data Model and Entity Relationships (The ERD)

This is the heart of your backend design. The following diagram shows how all your entities are related to each other.

-   `PK` = Primary Key (`id`)
-   `FK` = Foreign Key (a field that links to another entity's `id`)
-   `---` represents a relationship (e.g., One-to-Many)

```

        string id PK "User ID"
        string full_name

### Part 3: Explanation of Key Relationships

1.  Users and Teams (Many-to-Many):

    -   A `User` can be in many `Team`s.
    -   A `Team` can have many `User`s.
    -   This is achieved through the `TeamMember` entity, which acts as a "join table". It stores which `user_id` belongs to which `team_id` and what their `role` is in that specific team.
2.  Task Management Hierarchy (One-to-Many):

    -   A `Team` has one or more `Board`s. (Currently one, but the model supports more).
    -   A `Board` has many `List`s (e.g., To Do, Doing, Done).
    -   A `List` contains many `Task`s.
    -   This creates a clear, organized structure: `Team` -> `Board` -> `List` -> `Task`.
3.  Recurring Tasks:

    -   A `Team` owns many `TaskTemplate`s.
    -   A `TaskTemplate` can spawn many `Task`s over time. The `template_id` on a `Task` allows you to trace it back to its origin template.
4.  Form Management System:

    -   A `Team` owns many `Form`s.
    -   A `Form` is made up of many `FormField`s.
    -   A `Form` can be attached to many `FormSchedule`s.
    -   A `FormSchedule` generates many `FormAssignment`s for users based on its recurrence rule.
    -   A `FormAssignment` can result in one or more `FormSubmission`s (though typically one).
5.  The Task-Form Link (One-to-One):

    -   When a `FormAssignment` is created from a schedule, a corresponding `Task` is also created in the Kanban board.
    -   `FormAssignment.task_id` links to the `Task`.
    -   `Task.form_assignment_id` links back to the `FormAssignment`.
    -   This is a crucial link that integrates the two core systems of your application. Completing the task is tied to submitting the form.

This design provides a robust and scalable foundation for your application. The use of Base44's BaaS model means you can focus on building features and user experiences, while the platform handles the complex, undifferentiated work of managing servers, databases, and authentication.
